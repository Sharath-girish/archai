# Available Algorithms

Current the following algorithms are implemented:

* [Petridish](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/9202-efficient-forward-architecture-search.pdf)
* [DARTS](https://deepmind.com/research/publications/darts-differentiable-architecture-search)
* [Random search baseline]
* [XNAS](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/8472-xnas-neural-architecture-search-with-expert-advice.pdf) (this is currently experimental and has not been fully reproduced yet as authors have not released source code at the time of writing.)
* [DATA](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/8374-data-differentiable-architecture-approximation.pdf) (this is currently experimental and has not been fully reproduced yet as authors have not released source code at the time of writing.)

See [Roadmap](#roadmap) for details on new algorithms coming soon.
